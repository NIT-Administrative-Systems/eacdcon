# EACDcon Website
This is a repository with a website in it. That's all you need to know right now.

## Tech
This is using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is deployed to Github Pages as a public site.

It doesn't do anything on its own. It's static content.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
